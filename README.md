## How to regenerate assets

Assets can be generated by executing the gen_assets.bat script. Bitmap generation uses img2ard Ruby script made by yyyc514 and requires the chunky_png gem.

Here is a small guide about how to install Ruby and the chunky_ong gem on Windows:

1. Download the Ruby installer from https://rubyinstaller.org/
2. In the installer check 'Add Ruby executables to your PATH' before clicking 'Install'
3. Once ruby is installed open a shell (<windows key>cmd<enter>) and type the following commands to install the chunky_png gem:
```
gem sources -a http://rubygems.org/
gem install chunky_png
gem sources -r http://rubygems.org/
```
This is unfortunatly needed to go around this problem https://gist.github.com/luislavena/f064211759ee0f806c88
